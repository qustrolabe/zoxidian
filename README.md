# zoxidian

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that tracks which notes you visit and
ranks them using the [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) frecency
algorithm — the same idea that makes the `cd` replacement so good at predicting
where you want to go next.

## Features

- Sidebar panel sorted by frecency score
- Quick search modal (command palette → _Search recent notes_)
- Configurable max age and max items
