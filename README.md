# zoxidian

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that tracks which notes you visit and
ranks them using the [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) frecency
algorithm.

Notes you open a lot or opened recently automatically rise to the top of the
list in the sidebar. The plugin also adds a quick search modal, similar to
`Ctrl+O` with results ranked by the same frecency score.
